<h3 id="class-features">Class Features</h3>
<p>All of the following are class features of the forsworn paladin.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-and-armor-proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h2>
<p>forsworn paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons,
with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields
(except tower shields).</p>
<h2 id="detect-undead-su">Detect Undead (Su)</h2>
<p>This ability works like the standard paladin ability to detect evil,
except as detect undead instead of detect evil.</p>
<h2 id="personal-trial-su">Personal Trial (Su)</h2>
<p>Once per day, an forsworn paladin can as a swift action declare one
target within line of sight as his personal trial. The forsworn paladin
gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that
creature, to his AC against attacks made by the target, and on saving
throws against the target’s spells and special abilities. This bonus
increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum
bonus of +6 at 20th level. The personal trial effect remains until the
target of the trial is dead or the next time the paladin rests and
regains daily uses of this ability. At 4th level and every three levels
thereafter, the forsworn paladin can use personal trial one additional
time per day.</p>
<h2 id="shadow-resilience-su">Shadow Resilience (Su)</h2>
<p>At 2nd level, a forsworn paladin gains a bonus equal to his Charisma
bonus (if any) on all Saving Throws.</p>
<h2 id="touch-of-death-su">Touch of Death (Su)</h2>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, an forsworn paladin surrounds his hand with a
dark flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each
day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his forsworn
paladin + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, an forsworn paladin
can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two forsworn paladin levels he
possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke
attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an forsworn paladin can use this power to heal undead
creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the forsworn
paladin possesses. This ability is modified by any feat, spell, or
effect that specifically works with the lay on hands paladin class
feature. For example, the Extra Lay On Hands feat grants an forsworn
paladin 2 additional uses of the touch of death class feature.</p>
<h2 id="aura-of-fear-su">Aura of Fear (Su)</h2>
<p>At 3rd level, a forsworn paladin is immune to fear (magical or
otherwise). Each enemy within 10 feet of his must make a Will save equal
to 10 + half the forsworn paladin’s level + the forsworn paladin’s
Charisma modifier or become shaken for one round. This increases to 1d4
rounds at 10th level. This ability functions only while the forsworn
paladin is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
<h2 id="beoynd-live-ex">Beoynd Live (Ex)</h2>
<p>At 3rd level, a forsworn paladin is immune to all diseases, including
supernatural and magical diseases, including mummy rot.</p>
<h2 id="channel-negative-energy-su">Channel Negative Energy (Su)</h2>
<p>When an forsworn paladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural
ability to channel negative energy like a cleric. Using this ability
consumes two uses of his life drain touch ability. An forsworn paladin
uses his level as his effective cleric level when channeling negative
energy. This is a Charisma-based ability.</p>
<h2 id="versatile-channeler-su">Versatile Channeler (Su)</h2>
<p>When an forsworn paladin reaches 4th level, he gains Versatile Channeler
feat for free.</p>
<p>He also can use paladin's lay on hands ability as if his effective
paladin level was 2 levels lower than normal. Using paladin's lay on
hands ability consumes on use of his life drain touch ability.</p>
<h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>
<p>Beginning at 4th level, a forsworn paladin gains the ability to cast a
small number of divine spells which are drawn from the antipaladin spell
list. A forsworn paladin must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>
<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a forsworn paladin must have a Charisma
score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a
saving throw against a forsworn paladin’s spell is 10 + the spell level
+ the forsworn paladin’s Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>Like other spellcasters, a forsworn paladin can cast only a certain
number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: forsworn paladin. In addition, he receives
bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability
Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: forsworn paladin indicates that
the forsworn paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he
gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his
Charisma score for that spell level.</p>
<p>A forsworn paladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and
meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A forsworn paladin
may prepare and cast any spell on the antipaladin spell list, provided
that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells
to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>
<p>Through 3rd level, a forsworn paladin has no caster level. At 4th level
and higher, his caster level is equal to his forsworn paladin level – 3.</p>
<p>Bonus spells:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st</strong> — <em>wrath</em></li>
<li><strong>2nd</strong> — <em>confess</em></li>
<li><strong>3rd</strong> — <em>fester</em></li>
<li><strong>4th</strong> — <em>true seeing</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weapon-of-vengeance-sp">Weapon of Vengeance (Sp)</h2>
<p>Upon reaching 5th level, a forsworn paladin forms a bond with his
weapon.</p>
<p>This bond allows the forsworn paladin to enhance his weapon as a
standard action for 1 minute per paladin level. When enhanced, bond
causes the weapon to shed smoke and darknes as a torch. At 5th level,
this grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels
beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum
of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking
with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to
add any of the following weapon properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>+1</em>: flaming, keen, vicious</li>
<li><em>+2</em>: axiomatic, flaming burst, wounding</li>
<li><em>+3</em>: speed</li>
<li><em>+5</em>: vorpal</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the
property’s cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These
bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but
duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least
a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be
added. The bonus and properties are determined when ability is used and
cannot be changed until the next use. This bond imparts no bonuses if
the weapon is held by anyone other than the forsworn paladin but resumes
giving bonuses if returned to the forsworn paladin. These bonuses apply
to only one end of a double weapon. A forsworn paladin can use this
ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for
every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th
level.</p>
<p>If a bonded weapon is destroyed, the forsworn paladin loses the use of
this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes
first. During this 30-day period, the forsworn paladin takes a –1
penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>
<h2 id="life-drain-touch-su">Life Drain Touch (Su)</h2>
<p>At 6rd level and every three levels thereafter, a
forsworn paladin can select one life drain touch. Each life drain adds
an effect to the forsworn paladin’s touch of death ability. Whenever the
forsworn paladin uses touch of death to deal damage to one target, the
target also receives the additional effect from one of the life drains
possessed by the forsworn paladin’s. This choice is made when the touch
is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this life drain.
If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but
not the effects of the life drain. The DC of this save is equal to 10 +
1/2 the forsworn paladin’s level + the forsworn paladin’s Charisma
modifier.</p>
<p>At 6rd level, the forsworn paladin can select from the following initial
life drains.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fatigued</em>: The target is fatigued.</li>
<li><em>Shaken</em>: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the forsworn
    paladin.</li>
<li><em>Sickened</em>: The target is sickened for 1 round per level of the
    forsworn paladin.</li>
<li><em>Dazed</em>: The target is dazed for 1 round.</li>
<li><em>Staggered</em>: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of
    the forsworn paladin.</li>
</ul>
<p>At 9th level, an forsworn paladin adds the following life drains to the
list of those that can be selected.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cursed</em>: The target is cursed, as if the forsworn paladin had cast
    bestow curse, using his forsworn paladin level as his caster level.</li>
<li><em>Exhausted</em>: The target is exhausted. The forsworn paladin must have
    the fatigue life drain before selecting this life drain.</li>
<li><em>Frightened</em>: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of
    the forsworn paladin. The forsworn paladin must have the shaken life
    drain before selecting this life drain.</li>
<li><em>Nauseated</em>: The target is nauseated for 1 round per three levels of
    the forsworn paladin. The forsworn paladin must have the sickened
    life drain before selecting this life drain.</li>
<li><em>Poisoned</em>: The target is poisoned, as if the forsworn paladin had
    cast poison, using the forsworn paladin’s level as the caster level.</li>
</ul>
<p>At 12th level, an forsworn paladin adds the following life drains to the
list of those that can be selected.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blinded</em>: The target is blinded for 1 round per level of the
    forsworn paladin.</li>
<li><em>Deafened</em>: The target is deafened for 1 round per level of the
    forsworn paladin.</li>
<li><em>Paralyzed</em>: The target is paralyzed for 1 round.</li>
<li><em>Stunned</em>: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the
    forsworn paladin.</li>
</ul>
<p>These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level forsworn
paladin’s touch of corruption ability deals 6d6 points of damage and
might also cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, or poisoned. Once
a life drain is chosen, it can’t be changed.</p>
<h2 id="aura-of-undeath-su">Aura of Undeath (Su)</h2>
<p>At 8th level, He also gains the ability to Control Undead as per the
feat. Each undead ally or under his control within 10 feet of him gains
a +2 bonus on saving throws against channeling.</p>
<p>This ability functions only while the forsworn paladin is conscious, not
if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
<h2 id="aura-of-vengeance-su">Aura of Vengeance (Su)</h2>
<p>At 11th level, an forsworn paladin can expend two uses of his personal
trial ability to grant this ability to all allies within 10 feet, using
his bonuses. Allies must use this personal trial ability by the end of
next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a
free action.</p>
<h2 id="stalwart-ex">Stalwart (Ex)</h2>
<p>At 14th level, the forsworn paladin’s quest has strengthened his body
and mind. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an
effect that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids
the effect entirely. A helpless forsworn paladin does not gain the
benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>
<h2 id="aura-of-indomitability-su">Aura of Indomitability (Su)</h2>
<p>At 17th level, a forsworn paladin gains DR 5/— and a +4 morale bonus on
saving throws against compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of
his gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects.</p>
<p>This ability functions only while the forsworn paladin is conscious, not
if he is unconscious or dead.</p>
