## Plan to Be Frightened

Characters who aren’t afraid of anything — or who are
incapable of emotion — are the worst characters to play in
a horror adventure. If the slasher bursts onto the scene and
no one’s startled or frightened, that’s a bad sign for a horror
game. Fight-or-flight responses, instant reactions, and
expressions of revulsion are key components of a terrifying
scene. In horror adventures, it is the GM’s job to set up grim
scenarios, and it is part of your job to consider how your
character would actually react to these situations.

That doesn’t mean your character needs to be a shrieking
coward, though. Your character likely is skilled with weapons
or has the power to magically manipulate reality. By the
same token, your character should also be a person. In the
face of a terrifying encounter, consider how your character
would respond.

If you decide that your character would probably have
some sort of startled reaction to a scene, consider expressing
that. Your character’s actions might even intersect with
specific game rules. but in other cases you just want it to be flavorful
and not impede a more strategic response.

- **Cast a Protective Spell**: 
  You gird yourself with magic.
- **Draw a Weapon**: 
  Usually done while taking a step back,
  you both prepare for and distance yourself from danger.
- **Gape**: 
  You hold your ground, but look on in shock.
- **Guard**: 
  Moving into position between the threat and an
  ally, you try to prevent another from seeing the scene.
- **Pray/Swear**: 
  You call upon the gods or verbally express shock.
- **Retreat**: 
  You seek escape if the situation is overwhelming.

Screaming might also be an obvious reaction, but that
tends to be the domain of victims, not heroes (though,
everyone has the occasional less-than-heroic moment).
Retreating also seems distinctly unheroic, but in a horror
game, that might occasionally be the prudent choice,
especially if it is clear that a threat outmatches your group.
Remember that in horror games, combat is not always be the
surest path to victory.

# Fear


## Levels of Fear

#### Lesser Fear
1. **Spooked**: *The nature of your surroundings or events that you have witnessed makes you uneasy.*
     - -2 penalty on save vs Fear and Perception
     - -1 initiative roll on first round
2. **Shaken**: *Fear has taken hold of you and you are no longer thinking or acting clearly.*
     - -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks
3. **Scared**: *You are noticeably afraid, jumping at shadows and easily panicked by odd sights and unexplained noises.*
     - -4 penalty on save vs Fear
     - -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks
     - In addition, if being subject to a lesser fear effect would increase
       your fear level, you are staggered for 1 round instead.

#### Greater Fear

4. **Frightened**: *You are so afraid that you must flee from the source of your fear.*
     - All penalties of **scared**
     - On your turn, you must move away from any source of fear you perceive.
       You can use special abilities, such as spells and equipment, to flee and must
       resort to such abilities if they seem like the only way to escape.
     - If unable to flee, you can fight.
5. **Panicked**: This functions as the **frightened** condition,
     but you drop anything held whenever you are forced to flee
     and you flee in a random direction. In addition, you treat all
     sources of danger as fear sources and must flee from them as
     well. If unable to flee, you cower in fear.
6. **Terrified**: This functions as **panicked**, but you do not
     treat any other character as an ally and thus must attempt
     saving throws against spells that allow them, even if the
     spells are beneficial.
     Once you have fled from fear each round you roll on the following table
     to determine your course of action.
     - *01–25%* Continue to flee, moving away from any known source of danger.
     - *26–50%* Find a place nearby to hide, using Stealth as normal. You
       do nothing until you are discovered (and forced to run
       again) or you are no longer terrified
     - *51–75%* Lash out at the nearest creature, even an ally, attacking
       it with whatever weapon is available.
     - *76–100%* Do nothing. If you get this result in two consecutive
       rounds, you no longer need to roll on this chart starting
       on the third round and can act as normal unless you
       encounter a source of fear or danger, in which case you
       are still terrified and act accordingly.
7. **Horrified**: *You are transfixed with fear and can take no actions.*
     - -2 penalty to your AC and flat-footed
     - considered helpless
